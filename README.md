# Introduction 
This is a command-line based Library Management System designed to efficiently handle various operations of a library through a simple terminal interface. The program demonstrates a solid foundation in functional programming, making it both scalable and adaptable for multiple use cases. While the current implementation uses temporary, in-memory data storage, the application primarily serves as an excellent example of logical structuring and code organization.

Its modular structure makes it an ideal prototype that can later be expanded and integrated into full-fledged web applications using powerful Python frameworks such as Streamlit, Django, or Flask. These frameworks would allow for persistent data storage, authentication, and a user-friendly interface, transforming this CLI project into a robust and production-ready system.

# Tech stack 
##### Python: The core language used for development, chosen for its readability, simplicity, and strong community support.
